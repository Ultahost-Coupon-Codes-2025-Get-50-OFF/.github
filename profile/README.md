- **Free SSL Certificates**: Secure your site without paying $10-$50/year elsewhere.
- **Free Domain Transfer**: Move your existing domain to Ultahost for free.
- **Daily Backups**: Protect your data without buying a separate backup service.

These features can save you hundreds of dollars over time, especially if you’re running multiple websites.

### 3. Watch for Seasonal Sales

Ultahost loves to roll out massive discounts during big sales events. Black Friday and Cyber Monday are the best times to score deals, with discounts of up to **60% plus** extra coupons (like “BFCM25” for an additional 20% off).
